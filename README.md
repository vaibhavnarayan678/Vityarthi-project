# Vityarthi Number Theory Project  
**Class 12 Computer Science Project**  
*A Collection of Number-Theoretic Functions Implemented in Python*

---

### Overview  
This Jupyter Notebook contains a variety of simple, educational Python programs that demonstrate fundamental concepts in **Number Theory** and recreational mathematics. The project was created as a Class-12 school assignment and includes implementations of many classic functions and properties of integers.

### Features / Functions Included

| Miscellaneous: Factorial, digital root, Collatz steps, polygonal numbers, multiplicative persistence, etc. |

### How to Run  
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** (direct link works) or any Jupyter environment.  
2. Execute the cells one by one – most cells are independent mini-programs.  
3. When prompted, enter the required integer(s) and observe the output along with execution time.

### Requirements  
- Python 3  
- Standard libraries only (`time`, `math`) – no external packages needed.
